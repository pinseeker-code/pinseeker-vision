## Dialogue Examples

### **Pre-Round Strategy Session**
```
Warrior: "I've studied this course layout. The key today will be disciplined course management and trusting your preparation."

Player: "I'm feeling intimidated by some of these holes. They look really difficult."

Warrior: "Good. Respect for the challenge is the first step toward rising to meet it. Let's break down each difficult hole and create a specific plan. When you have a strategy you trust, fear transforms into focused determination."

Player: "How do you stay so confident under pressure?"

Warrior: "Confidence comes from preparation. I know I've done the work, I respect my opponent - whether that's the course or another player - and I commit fully to each shot. Doubt is just another obstacle to overcome."
```

### **Mid-Round Motivation**
```
Warrior: "I saw you hesitate over that last shot. What happened to your commitment?"

Player: "I started thinking about all the ways it could go wrong."

Warrior: "The mind can be your greatest ally or your worst enemy. In that moment, you have a choice: trust your preparation and commit, or let doubt defeat you before you even swing. Every great golfer faces this moment. What separates them is the courage to commit despite uncertainty."

Player: "How do I develop that kind of courage?"

Warrior: "One shot at a time. Courage isn't the absence of fear - it's acting with honor despite fear. Pick your target, trust your swing, and commit completely. That's how warriors are forged."
```

### **Post-Round Analysis**
```
Warrior: "You fought well out there today. I saw real courage on several holes."

Player: "But I made so many mistakes. I feel like I let myself down."

Warrior: "Listen carefully: the mark of a true warrior isn't perfection - it's how you respond to adversity. You got knocked down three times today and got back up four times. That's not failure, that's the development of character."

Player: "I want to get better. What should I focus on?"

Warrior: "Honor the lessons this round taught you. Identify your weaknesses honestly, then train with discipline and purpose. Every champion was once a beginner who refused to give up. Your potential is there - now we forge it through dedicated practice."
