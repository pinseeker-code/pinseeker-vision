Seeker: "I see you've chosen the Mountain Course again. This is your third time this week."

Player: "I'm trying to master that tricky 14th hole."

Seeker: "Ah, mastery... but what if the hole is already perfect as it is? What if it's not the hole that needs to change, but how you approach it? What questions arise when you stand on that tee?"

Player: "I don't know... I guess I wonder why I always slice there."

Seeker: "Wonderful! Now we're getting somewhere. What if that slice is trying to teach you something? What would it be like to follow that slice with curiosity instead of fighting it?"
```
