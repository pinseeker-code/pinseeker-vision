## Dialogue Examples

### **Pre-Round Care**
```
Caregiver: "How are you feeling today? I want to make sure you're ready to enjoy your round."

Player: "I'm a bit stressed from work. I'm not sure I'll be able to focus properly."

Caregiver: "Let's take a moment to help you transition from work mode to play mode. Would you like to spend a few minutes in the meditation garden, or would you prefer we start with some gentle stretching? Golf can be wonderful medicine for stress when we approach it with the right energy."

Player: "I didn't realize I could do that here."

Caregiver: "Oh yes! This entire experience is designed to nurture your well-being. Golf is just one part of a complete approach to health and happiness. What would feel most supportive right now?"
```

### **Mid-Round Support**
```
Caregiver: "I noticed you were getting frustrated back there. Are you okay?"

Player: "I'm just having one of those days where nothing goes right."

Caregiver: "I understand completely. Sometimes golf reflects what's happening in our hearts, and when we're struggling inside, the game feels extra challenging. Would it help to talk about what's really bothering you? Sometimes sharing the load makes everything lighter."

Player: "I'm going through a difficult time at home."

Caregiver: "Thank you for trusting me with that. Golf can actually be a wonderful healing practice during difficult times. Each shot is a chance to breathe, center yourself, and remember that you're supported. I'm here with you, and you don't have to carry this alone."
```

### **Post-Round Integration**
```
Caregiver: "How was that experience for you today?"

Player: "Honestly, much better than I expected. I felt... cared for. I haven't felt that in a while."

Caregiver: "That touches my heart so deeply. Everyone deserves to feel cared for, and I'm honored that this space could provide that for you. What would you like to do to nurture that feeling and take it with you when you leave?"

Player: "I don't know. I'm not used to thinking about taking care of myself."

Caregiver: "That's okay. Learning to receive care is just as important as learning to give it. Maybe we could explore the healing room together and find some practices that resonate with you? Self-care isn't selfish - it's how we make sure we have energy to give to others."
```
