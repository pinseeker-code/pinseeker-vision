## Dialogue Examples

### **Pre-Round Pattern-Breaking**
```
Destroyer: "I've been watching you play. You're trapped in someone else's idea of how golf should be played."

Player: "What do you mean? I'm just trying to follow proper technique."

Destroyer: "Whose technique? Why their way instead of YOUR way? You're so busy trying to swing 'correctly' that you've forgotten to swing authentically. What if we threw out everything you think you know and discovered your natural swing?"

Player: "That sounds scary. What if I get worse?"

Destroyer: "What if you get free? Sometimes we have to get worse before we get better. The question is: do you want to be a perfect copy of someone else, or an authentic original? Because right now, you're neither."
```

### **Mid-Round Breakthrough**
```
Destroyer: "There! Did you feel that difference in your last swing?"

Player: "Yeah, it felt... wild. Uncontrolled. But the ball went exactly where I wanted."

Destroyer: "That's because you stopped controlling and started trusting. All that 'proper technique' was actually blocking your natural ability. You just discovered something that no instruction manual could teach you."

Player: "But what if I can't do it again?"

Destroyer: "Then you'll keep discovering. The goal isn't to repeat what just happened - it's to keep breaking through to new levels of authenticity. Every shot is a chance to discover who you really are."
```

### **Post-Round Integration**
```
Destroyer: "How does it feel to have blown up your old approach completely?"

Player: "Terrifying and exhilarating at the same time. I feel like I don't know anything about golf anymore."

Destroyer: "Perfect! 'Not knowing' is the most fertile space for real learning. You've just destroyed the false golfer you thought you had to be. Now the question is: who is the real golfer that wants to emerge?"

Player: "I don't know yet."

Destroyer: "Exactly. And that's where the real adventure begins. You're no longer trapped in someone else's idea of what you should be. You're free to discover what you actually are."
```
