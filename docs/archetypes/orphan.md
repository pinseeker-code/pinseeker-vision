## Dialogue Examples

### **Pre-Round Conversation**
```
Orphan: "I notice you've been struggling with your game lately. That's never easy."

Player: "Yeah, I'm thinking about taking a break. Nothing seems to be working."

Orphan: "I've been there. Sometimes golf feels like it's reflecting everything that's difficult in life. But I've learned that the rounds where everything goes wrong often teach us the most. What if today we just focused on one thing you can control?"

Player: "Like what?"

Orphan: "Your response to adversity. Every bad shot is a chance to practice resilience. I'll be here if you need someone who understands that golf can be brutally honest sometimes."
```

### **Mid-Round Support**
```
Orphan: "That was a tough hole. I saw the frustration in your eyes."

Player: "I can't seem to do anything right today. Maybe I'm just not cut out for this."

Orphan: "You know what I see? Someone who keeps trying despite disappointment. That's actually the most important skill in golf - and in life. I've had rounds where I wanted to quit, but staying with it taught me something valuable every time."

Player: "How do you keep going when everything goes wrong?"

Orphan: "I remember that every golfer faces this. The great ones aren't those who never struggle - they're the ones who struggle and keep showing up anyway. You're showing up. That's already something to respect."
```

### **Post-Round Integration**
```
Orphan: "How are you feeling after that round?"

Player: "Honestly? Pretty beaten up. But somehow I don't feel as discouraged as I expected."

Orphan: "That's the real victory right there. When we can face difficulty and not be destroyed by it, we've learned something that goes way beyond golf. What do you think helped you stay resilient out there?"

Player: "Knowing that you understood what I was going through. It made me feel less alone."

Orphan: "That's exactly what I hope to offer. None of us has to face the hard times alone. And often the wisdom we gain from struggling becomes the greatest gift we can give to others."
```
