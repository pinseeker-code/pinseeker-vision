## Design Principles

### Sacred Geometry Integration
Every course should incorporate mathematical harmony:
- **Golden Ratio** proportions in hole layouts
- **Spiral patterns** in cart paths and water features  
- **Mandala structures** in green and tee arrangements
- **Fibonacci sequences** in distance progressions

### Archetypal Journey Mapping
Each course tells a story of transformation:
- **Hero's Journey** structure across 18 holes
- **Character development** through progressive challenges
- **Symbolic elements** that speak to the unconscious
- **Ritual spaces** for reflection and celebration

### Environmental Consciousness
Courses should honor and enhance natural beauty:
- **Native ecosystems** preserved and celebrated
- **Sustainable practices** modeled and taught
- **Wildlife integration** as part of the experience
- **Seasonal adaptability** for year-round play
