Pinseeker: Secure Nostr-Shopify Integration Architecture

This document outlines a secure, production-ready architecture for integrating Nostr and Lightning 
features into the Pinseeker Shopify store. It replaces the prototype scripts with a modern, 
server-side approach prioritizing security, scalability, and maintainability.

1. High-Level Overview
The architecture integrates Nostr for user authentication and content publishing, and Lightning 
for microtransactions (zaps). It uses a layered approach with a lightweight frontend, a 
serverless backend for sensitive operations, and an automation layer for RSS-to-Nostr publishing.


2. Core Architecture Components

1. **Frontend (Shopify Theme)**:
 - Nostr login button (using nostr-auth-middleware, not direct JS).
 - Lightning zap widget with Alby Paywall or BTCPay fallback.
 - Loads a custom JavaScript SDK to interact with the backend.
2. **Backend (Cloudflare Worker or AWS Lambda)**:
 - Handles Nostr event signing using server-side keys stored as environment
variables.
 - Publishes content to multiple Nostr relays with fallback logic.
 - Issues JWT tokens for authenticated sessions.
 - Provides XP and activity logging endpoints.
3. **Automation Layer**: A dedicated `nostrss` service for RSS-to-Nostr publishing.
 - Runs on a schedule (cron or AWS EventBridge) to sync Shopify blog posts
with Nostr relays.
 - Includes error handling, retry logic, and logging.
4. **Data & Security**:
 - Private keys never exposed to frontend.
 - Environment variables for keys (nsec) and API tokens.
 - HTTPS/TLS for all requests.


3. User Flow

1. A visitor clicks "Login with Nostr" on Shopify.
2. The frontend prompts the user to sign a challenge via their Nostr key.
3. The signed challenge is verified by the backend, which creates a JWT
session.
4. The user can tip/zap via the Lightning button, earning XP in their account.
5. When a new blog post is published, the automation layer pushes it to Nostr
relays.
4. Future Features
- XP and leveling system integration with Nostr events.
- Archetype-based achievements tied to user activity.
- Generative clubhouse feed (optional) synced with relay content.
- AI-driven content recommendation for user interactions.


5. Next Steps

1. Deploy a Cloudflare Worker for secure Nostr event publishing.
2. Integrate Shopify App Bridge to avoid direct theme edits.
3. Set up an Alby or BTCPay Lightning payment handler with fallback UX.
4. Configure the `nostrss` automation service for RSS-to-Nostr syncing.
